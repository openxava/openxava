The automated tests in this project do not include CSS style. 
Therefore, when you touch the CSSs you have to test it visually
with Terra and Light theme at least the next cases:
- Delivery: List mode with cursor.
	- When row is colored and selectable, it's respond when clicked. Even not clicking on the text.
		(It fails currently: https://openxava.org/xavaprojects/o/OpenXava/m/Issue?detail=ff8080818de6fbe7018dea720e5e0007)
	- Dates for "Date as label" column are shown completely.
	- Narrow the browser, the content of type and description columns are not overlapped between rows.  
- Invoice: Go to first detail. 
	- Checkbox of paid must be well aligned.
	- Action links in name of customer and street of address must be well aligned.
	- The editors for street (with regular label) and postal code (with small label) must be well aligned.
		(Here we tolerate the street label slightly to up)
	- The editors for city (no label) and state (small label) must be well aligned.
	- The label of photo must be well aligned (top or middle but not ugly).

	- Go to first detail.
	- Click to edit the project, so a dialog is shown.
	- Dialog data is readable, white over black, instead of black over black.

	- On hover in date icon and descriptions list open icon is readable.
	- Open the descriptions list combo, the background is black.
