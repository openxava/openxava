The automated tests in this project do not include pretty layout of UI. 
Therefore, when you touch the layout code (a.k.a. JSPs) you have to test it visually
at least the next cases:
- InvoiceCustomerNoFrame: The properties before frames must be well aligned and on left.
- ProductWithGroups: Data 1 and Data 2 groups in the same row. 
	Data 2 frame must be aligned with Remarks and Photos frames on right.
- Product4NoDescriptionsLists: Fields inside frames must be nicely aligned by column.
- Product5WithGroups: Features and Prices groups in different lines and filling all the width.
- CustomerSellerAsDescriptionsListShowingReferenceViewNoFrameInSection: Members in section should have a nice layout.
- Movie3WithSection: The @Files property is shown and fill all the section width.
- Invoice: In Amounts section all the fields are aligned to left with labels and fields near.
- CarrierWithCollectionsTogether: Collections frames aligned with Header frame on right. 
- Movie3: Button must be in the same row with @File and should be align vertically in the middle of the div.

With flowLayout=true in xava.properties:
- Customer: The icon of 'Web site' property must be on right, inside the field.
- Customer: Seller group must have all the properties well aligned. 
	The number and name of customer must be placed in one line or two when resized. 
	No matter if 'Relation with seller' is in a new line (by now). 
- ProductWithGroups: Data 1 and Data 2 groups in the same row. 
	When you narrow the screen they must place one by row, but aligned in all moment.
	Data 2 frame must be aligned with Remarks and Photos frames on right.
- Product2: All properties well aligned, including the descriptionsLists.
- Movie3WithSection: The @Files property is shown and fill all the section width.
- Invoice: In Amounts section the fields are in one row (when enough space), nicely aligned.	
- CarrierWithCollectionsTogether: Collections frames aligned with Header frame on right.
- Warehouse: Simple, one field below other.
- WarehouseInGroup: Simple, one field below other, inside the group frame.
- WarehouseInSection: Simple, one field below other, inside the section.
- CustomerAddress: Simple, one field below other, inside the embeddable frame.
