	In many business applications, it is necessary for each user
	to see only the data that corresponds to them, such as their orders, invoices, or tasks.
	This control is essential to streamline work and also to protect
	information. This would be what is known as row-level security in
	the database world.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	OpenXava solves this problem in a simple way through
	<a href="tab_en.html#Tabular%20data-Filters%20and%20base%20condition">filters and base conditions
	in the lists</a>, which allows restricting the visibility of data
	according to the connected user or their role.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="filter-list-data">Filtering data by user in the list</h2>   
	
	<p>It is enough to define a <i>baseCondition</i> in the
	<i><a href="https://openxava.org/OpenXavaDoc/apidocs/org/openxava/annotations/Tab.html">@Tab</a></i>
	for the property that contains the user name, using
	<i><a href="https://openxava.org/OpenXavaDoc/apidocs/org/openxava/filters/UserFilter.html">UserFilter</a></i>
	as filter. For example, if we have a <i>Task</i> entity with a <i>user</i> property that stores
	the user who has the task assigned, we could define the <i>@Tab</i> like this:</p>
	
	<pre><code class="java">import org.openxava.filters.UserFilter;

@Entity
@Tab(filter=UserFilter.class, baseCondition="${user} = ?")
public class Task {
    
    @Column(length=50, name="USERNAME")
    private String user;
    
    // Rest of properties and methods
}</code></pre>
	
	<p>In this example, the annotation <i>@Tab(filter=UserFilter.class, baseCondition="${user} = ?")</i>
	establishes a base condition that automatically filters the data by the user
	currently identified in the application. The <i>UserFilter</i> is a predefined filter
	in OpenXava that provides the name of the connected user, while the expression
	<i>${user}</i> refers to the <i>user</i> property of the entity. The question
	mark <i>?</i> will be replaced by the value returned by the filter, that is,
	the name of the user who has logged in.</p>

	<p>With this configuration, each user will only see their own tasks in the list.</p>
	
	<h2 id="restricting-data-in-detail-mode">Restricting data in detail mode</h2>
	
	<p>
	Since OpenXava version 7.4.2, the framework automatically prevents access
	in detail mode to data that is not included in the list. This means that if you have
	configured a <i>UserFilter</i> in your <i>@Tab</i> as explained in the previous section,
	you don't need to do anything additional to restrict access to data in detail mode.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This behavior works with both permanent links (permalinks) and the
	standard search action, ensuring that users can only see in detail
	the records that correspond to them according to the applied filters.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you are using a version prior to 7.4.2, you should implement your own
	search action (using <i>XAVA_SEARCH_ACTION</i>) with the necessary logic to
	prevent the query of data that does not belong to the current user. For more information
	on how to override the default search, see the section
	<a href="controllers_en.html#Controllers-Overwriting%20default%20search">Overwriting
	default search</a> in the controllers documentation.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="default-value-for-user">Default value for user</h2>
	
	<p>
	To automatically assign the current user to new records, there are two
	main options depending on whether you want the user field to be visible
	or not in the user interface.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Option 1: Visible but non-editable user</h3>
	
	<p>If you want the user field to be visible in the interface but not editable:</p>
	
	<pre><code class="java">@DefaultValueCalculator(CurrentUserCalculator.class)
@ReadOnly
@Column(length=50, name="USERNAME")
private String user;</code></pre>
	
	<p>
	In this case, <i>@DefaultValueCalculator(CurrentUserCalculator.class)</i> automatically assigns
	the name of the current user when a new record is created, while
	<i>@ReadOnly</i> prevents the user from modifying this value.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember to import the <i>CurrentUserCalculator</i> class:
	</p>
	
	<pre><code class="java">import org.openxava.calculators.CurrentUserCalculator;</code></pre>
	
	<h3>Option 2: Hidden user</h3>
	
	<p>If you prefer that the user field is not visible in the interface:</p>
	
	<pre><code class="java">@Hidden
@Column(length=50, name="USERNAME")
private String user;

@PrePersist
public void assignCurrentUser() {
    this.user = Users.getCurrent();
}</code></pre>
	
	<p>
	In this option, the <i>@Hidden</i> annotation hides the field in the user interface,
	and the method annotated with <i>@PrePersist</i> is automatically executed before
	persisting the entity, assigning the current user through <i>Users.getCurrent()</i>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This second option is useful when the user does not need to see who is the owner
	of the record, since it will always be themselves, and it simplifies the interface by hiding
	fields that do not require interaction.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember to import the <i>Users</i> class if you use the second option:
	</p>
	
	<pre><code class="java">import org.openxava.util.Users;</code></pre>
	
	<h2 id="restricting-data-by-role">Restricting data by role <em>(new in v7.6)</em></h2>
	
	<p><i>This functionality is only available in <a href="https://openxava.org/xavapro/">XavaPro</a></i></p>
	
	<p>
	In XavaPro, a user can have a group of roles associated. The framework provides
	a filter called <i>RolesFilter</i> that allows restricting access to data according to
	the roles of the current user. This filter works by comparing the user's roles with
	a property of the entity that contains a role name.
	</p>
	
	<p>To implement this restriction, follow these steps:</p>
	
	<h3>1. Define a property for the role in your entity</h3>
	
	<pre><code class="java">@Column(length=30, columnDefinition = "VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT 'user'")
private String role;</code></pre>
	
	<p>
	This property will store the name of the role that has permission to access the record.
	You can set a default value if you wish, as in the previous example where
	the default value is 'user'.
	</p>
	
	<h3>2. Configure the filter in the @Tab annotation</h3>
	
	<pre><code class="java">@Tab(baseCondition = "${role} IN (?)",
    filter=com.openxava.naviox.filters.RolesFilter.class,
    properties="year, number, date, customer.number, customer.name, ...")</code></pre>
	
	<p>
	The base condition <i>${role} IN (?)</i> indicates that records will be filtered where
	the value of the <i>role</i> property is included in the list of roles of the current
	user. The <i>RolesFilter</i> automatically provides this list of roles.
	</p>
	
	<h3>3. How it works</h3>
	
	<p>
	When a user accesses the list, the <i>RolesFilter</i> gets all the
	roles assigned to the current user and uses them to filter the data. For example:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If a user has only the 'user' role assigned, they will only see records where
		the <i>role</i> property has the value 'user'.</li>
		<li>If a user has the 'admin' and 'user' roles assigned, they will see the records
		where the <i>role</i> property has the value 'admin' or 'user'.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	This allows implementing a role-based data access system, where different
	types of users can see different sets of data according to their assigned roles.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember to import the necessary classes:
	</p>
	
	<pre><code class="java">import com.openxava.naviox.filters.RolesFilter; // Note: package com.openxava.naviox, not org.openxava</code></pre>
