      In previous lessons you learned how to add your own actions. However this
      is not enough to fully customize the behavior of your application, because
      the generated user interface, in concrete the user interface for
      references and collections, has a standard behavior that sometimes is not
      the most convenient. <br>
      Fortunately, OpenXava provides many ways to customize the behavior for
      references and collections. In this lesson you will learn how to do some
      of these customizations, and how this adds value to your application.
      <h2><a name="refining-reference-behavior"></a>Refining reference behavior</h2>
      You might have noticed that the <i>Order</i> module has a little slip:
      the user can add any invoice he wants to the current order, even if the
      invoice customer was different. This is not acceptable. Let's fix it.
      <h3><a name="validation-is-good-but-not-enough"></a>Validation is good,
        but not enough</h3>
      The user can only associate an invoice to an order if both, invoice and
      order, belong to the same customer. This is specific business logic of
      your application, so the standard OpenXava behavior does not solve it. The
      next image shows as a validation error is produced when customer of
      invoice is incorrect </div>
    <img src="files/references-collections_en010.png" alt="references-collections_en010"
      title="references-collections_en010">
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;"> Since this is business logic we
      are going to put it in the model layer, that is, in the entities. We'll do
      it adding a validation. Thus you'll get the effect of the above figure.
      You already know how to add this validation to your <i>Order </i>entity.
      It's just adding a method annotated with <i>@AssertTrue</i>:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">public class Order {

    ...

    // This method must return true for this order to be valid
    @AssertTrue(message="customer_order_invoice_must_match") 
    private boolean isInvoiceCustomerMatches() {
    	return invoice == null || // invoice is optional
    		invoice.getCustomer().getNumber() == getCustomer().getNumber();
    }

}
</code></pre>Also you have to add the message to <i>i18n/Invoicing-messages_en.properties</i>:</div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">
      <pre><code class="properties">customer_order_invoice_must_match=The customer of the invoice and the order must match
</code></pre> </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;"> Here we verify that the customer
      of the invoice is the same as the customer of this order. This is enough
      to preserve the data integrity, but this validation alone is a poor option
      from the user viewpoint.
      <h3><a name="refining-action-for-searching-reference-with-list"></a>Refining
        action for searching reference with list</h3>
      Although validation prevents the user from assigning an incorrect invoice
      to an order, he has a hard time trying to find a correct invoice. Because
      when the user clicks to search an invoice, all existing invoices are
      shown. We are going to improve this for showing only the invoices from the
      customer of the current displayed order, in this way:</div>
    <img src="files/references-collections_en020.png" alt="references-collections_en020.png"
      title="references-collections_en020.png"><br>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;"> For defining our own search
      action for the invoice reference we will use the <i>@SearchAction</i>
      annotation. Here you have the needed modification in <i>Order</i>
      class:&nbsp;
      <pre><code class="java">public class Order extends CommercialDocument {

    @ManyToOne
    @ReferenceView("NoCustomerNoOrders")
    @OnChange(ShowHideCreateInvoiceAction.class)
    @SearchAction("Order.searchInvoice") // To define our own action to search invoices
    Invoice invoice;

    ...
	
}
</code></pre> In this simple way we define the action to execute when the user
      clicks on the flashlight button to search an invoice. The argument used
      for <i> @SearchAction</i>, <i>Order.searchInvoice</i>, is the qualified
      name of the action, that is the action <i>searchInvoice</i> of the
      controller <i>Order</i> as defined in <i> controllers.xml</i> file. Now
      we have to edit <i>controllers.xml</i> to add the definition of our new
      action:
      <pre><code class="xml">&lt;controller name="Order"&gt;

    ...
	
    &lt;action name="searchInvoice"
        class="com.yourcompany.invoicing.actions.SearchInvoiceFromOrderAction"
        hidden="true" icon="magnify"/&gt;
        &lt;!--
        hidden="true" : Because we don't want the action to be shown in module button bar
        icon="magnify" : The same icon as for the standard search action
        --&gt;
	
&lt;/controller&gt;
</code></pre> Our action extends from <i>ReferenceSearchAction</i> as shown in
      the next code:
      <pre><code class="java">package com.yourcompany.invoicing.actions; // In 'actions' package

import org.openxava.actions.*; // To use ReferenceSearchAction

public class SearchInvoiceFromOrderAction
    extends ReferenceSearchAction { // Standard logic for searching a reference

    public void execute() throws Exception {
        int customerNumber =
            getView().getValueInt("customer.number"); // Reads from the view the
                                         // customer number of the current order
        super.execute(); // It executes the standard logic that shows a dialog
        if (customerNumber &gt; 0) { // If there is customer we use it to filter
            getTab().setBaseCondition("${customer.number} = " + customerNumber);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre> Note how we use <i>getTab().setBaseCondition()</i> to establish a
      condition for the list to choose the reference. That is, from a <i>
        ReferenceSearchAction</i> you can use <i>getTab()</i> to manipulate the
      way the search list behaves. <br>
      If there is no customer we don't add any condition so all the invoices
      will be shown, this is the case when the user chooses the invoice before
      choosing the customer.
      <h3><a name="searching-the-reference-typing-in-fields"></a>Searching the
        reference typing in fields</h3>
      The list for choosing a reference already works fine. However, we want to
      give the user the possibility to choose the invoice without the list, by
      just typing the year and number. Very useful if the user already know
      which invoice he wants. OpenXava provides this functionality by default.
      If the <i>@Id</i> fields are displayed in the reference they are used for
      searching, otherwise OpenXava uses the first displayed field to search.
      This is not convenient in our case, because the first displayed field is
      the year, and searching an invoice only by year is not very precise. The
      following image shows the default behavior and a more convenient
      alternative:<br>
      <img src="files/references-collections_en030.png" alt="references-collections_en030.png"
        title="references-collections_en030.png"><br>
      Fortunately it's easy to indicate which fields we want to use to search
      from a user perspective. This is done by means of <i>@SearchKey</i>
      annotation. Just edit the <i>CommercialDocument</i> class (remember, the
      parent of <i>Order</i> and <i> Invoice</i>) and add that annotation to
      the <i>year</i> and <i>number</i> properties:
      <pre><code class="java">abstract public class CommercialDocument extends Deletable {

    @SearchKey // Add this annotation here
    @Column(length=4)
    @DefaultValueCalculator(CurrentYearCalculator.class) 
    int year;

    @SearchKey // Add this annotation here 
    @Column(length=6)
    @ReadOnly
    int number;
	
    ...
	
}
</code></pre> In this way when the user searches an order or invoice from a
      reference he must type the year and the number, and the corresponding
      entity will be retrieved from database and will populate the user
      interface. <br>
      Now it's easy for the user to choose an invoice for the order without
      using the searching list, just by typing year and number.
      <h3><a name="refining-action-for-searching-reference-typing-key"></a>Refining
        action for searching reference typing key</h3>
      Now that retrieving an invoice by the year and number is usable, we want
      to refine it in order to help our user to do his work more efficiently.
      For example, it would be useful that if the user has not chosen a customer
      for the order yet and he chooses an invoice, the customer of that invoice
      will be assigned to the current order automatically. The following image
      visualizes the wanted behavior:<br>
      <img src="files/references-collections_en040.png" alt="references-collections_en040.png"
        title="references-collections_en040.png"><br>
      On the other hand, if the user already has selected the customer for the
      order, if he is not the same in the invoice, it will be rejected and a
      message error displayed, just in this way:</div>
    <img src="files/references-collections_en050.png" alt="references-collections_en050.png"
      title="references-collections_en050.png"><br>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;"> For defining this special
      behavior we have to add an <i>@OnChangeSearch</i> annotation in the the <i>invoice</i>
      reference of <i>Order</i>. <i>@OnChangeSearch</i> allows you to define
      your own action to do the search of the reference when its key changes in
      the user interface. You can see the modified reference here:
      <pre><code class="java">public class Order extends CommercialDocument {
 
    @ManyToOne
    @ReferenceView("NoCustomerNoOrders") 
    @OnChange(ShowHideCreateInvoiceAction.class)
    @OnChangeSearch(OnChangeSearchInvoiceAction.class) // Add this annotation
    @SearchAction("Order.searchInvoice")
    Invoice invoice;
	
    ...
	
}	
</code></pre> From now on when the user types a new year and number for the
      invoice, the logic of <i>OnChangeSearchInvoiceAction</i> will be
      executed. In this action you have to read the invoice data from database
      and update the user interface. This is the action code:
      <pre><code class="java">package com.yourcompany.invoicing.actions; // In 'actions' package

import java.util.*;
import org.openxava.actions.*; // To use OnChangeSearchAction
import org.openxava.model.*;
import org.openxava.view.*;
import com.yourcompany.invoicing.model.*;

public class OnChangeSearchInvoiceAction 
    extends OnChangeSearchAction { // Standard logic for searching a reference when
                                   // the key values change in the user interface (1)
    public void execute() throws Exception {
        super.execute(); // It executes the standard logic (2)
        Map keyValues = getView()// getView() here is the reference view, not the main one (3)
            .getKeyValuesWithValue();
        if (keyValues.isEmpty()) return; // If key is empty no additional logic is executed
        Invoice invoice = (Invoice) // We search the Invoice entity from the typed key (4)
            MapFacade.findEntity(getView().getModelName(), keyValues);
        View customerView = getView().getRoot().getSubview("customer"); // (5)
        int customerNumber = customerView.getValueInt("number");
        if (customerNumber == 0) { // If there is no customer we fill it (6)
            customerView.setValue("number", invoice.getCustomer().getNumber());
            customerView.refresh();
        } 
        else { // If there is already customer we verify that he matches the invoice customer (7)
            if (customerNumber != invoice.getCustomer().getNumber()) {
                addError("invoice_customer_not_match", 
                    invoice.getCustomer().getNumber(), invoice, customerNumber);
                getView().clear();
            }
        }
    }
}	
</code></pre> Given the action extends from <i>OnChangeSearchAction</i> (1) and
      we use <i>super.execute() </i>(2) it behaves just in the standard way,
      that is, when the user types a year and number the invoice data is
      retrieved and fills the user interface. Afterwards, we use <i>getView()</i>
      (3) to obtain the key of the displayed invoice to find the corresponding
      entity using <i>MapFacade</i> (4). From inside an <i>OnChangeSearchAction</i>
      <i>getView()</i> returns the subview of the reference, and not the global
      view. Therefore, in this case <i>getView()</i> is the view of the invoice
      reference. This allows you to create more reusable <i>@OnChangeSearch</i>
      actions. Thus you have to write <i>getView().getRoot().getSubview("customer")</i>
      (5) to access to the customer view. <br>
      To implement the behavior visualized in the previous image, the action
      asks if there is no customer (<i>customberNumber == 0</i>) (6). If this is
      the case it fills the customer from the customer of the invoice. Otherwise
      it implements the logic from previous image verifying that the customer of
      the current order matches the customer of the retrieved invoice. <br>
      The last remaining detail is the message text. Add the next entry to the <i>Invoicing-messages_en.properties</i>
      file of <i>i18n</i> folder.
      <pre><code class="properties">invoice_customer_not_match=Customer Nº {0} of invoice {1} does not match with customer Nº {2} of the current order
</code></pre> One interesting thing about <i>@OnChangeSearch</i> is that it is
      also executed when the invoice is chosen from a list, because in this case
      the year and number of the invoice also changes. Hence, this is a
      centralized place to refine the logic for retrieving the reference and
      populating the view.
      <h2><a name="refining-collection-behavior"></a>Refining collection
        behavior</h2>
      We can refine collections in the same way we have refined references. This
      is very useful, because it allows us to improve the current behavior of
      the <i>Invoice </i>module. The user can only add an order to an invoice
      if the invoice and the orders belongs to the same customer. Moreover, the
      order must be delivered and must not have an invoice yet.
      <h3><a name="refining-the-list-for-adding-elements-to-a-collection"></a>Refining
        the list for adding elements to a collection</h3>
      Currently when the user tries to add orders to an invoice all the orders
      are available. We are going to improve this for showing only the orders
      from the customer of the invoice, delivered and with not invoice yet, just
      as shown: <br>
      <img src="files/references-collections_en60.png" alt="references-collections_en60.png"
        title="references-collections_en60.png"><br>
      We will use the <i>@AddAction</i> annotation for defining our own action
      to show the list for adding orders. The following code shows the needed
      modification in <i>Invoice</i> class.
      <pre><code class="java">public class Invoice extends CommercialDocument {

    @OneToMany(mappedBy="invoice")
    @CollectionView("NoCustomerNoInvoice")
    @AddAction("Invoice.addOrders") // To define our own action to add orders
    Collection&lt;Order&gt; orders;

    ...
	
}
</code></pre> In this simple way we define the action to execute when the user
      clicks on the button to add orders. The argument used for <i>@AddAction</i>,
      <i>Invoice.addOrders</i>, is the qualified name of the action, that is the
      action <i>addOrders</i> of the controller <i>Invoice</i> as defined in <i>
        controllers.xml</i> file. <br>
      Now we have to edit <i>controllers.xml</i> to add the <i>Invoice</i>
      controller (it does not exist yet) definition with our new action:
      <pre><code class="xml">&lt;controller name="Invoice"&gt;
    &lt;extends controller="Invoicing"/&gt;

    &lt;action name="addOrders"
        class="com.yourcompany.invoicing.actions.GoAddOrdersToInvoiceAction"
        hidden="true" icon="table-row-plus-after"/&gt;
        &lt;!--
        hidden="true" : Because we don't want the action to be shown in module button bar
        icon="table-row-plus-after" : The same icon as for the standard action
        --&gt;

&lt;/controller&gt;
</code></pre>This is the action code:
      <pre><code class="java">package com.yourcompany.invoicing.actions; // In 'actions' package

import org.openxava.actions.*; // To use GoAddElementsToCollectionAction

public class GoAddOrdersToInvoiceAction
    extends GoAddElementsToCollectionAction { // Standard logic to go to
                                              // adding collection elements list
    public void execute() throws Exception {
        super.execute(); // It executes the standard logic, that shows a dialog
        int customerNumber =
            getPreviousView() // getPreviousView() is the main view (we are in a dialog)
                .getValueInt("customer.number"); // Reads the customer number
                                                 // of the current invoice from the view
        getTab().setBaseCondition( // The condition of the orders list to add
            "${customer.number} = " + customerNumber +
            " and ${delivered} = true and ${invoice} is null"
        );
    }
}
</code></pre> Note how we use <i>getTab().setBaseCondition()</i> to establish a
      condition for the list to choose the entities to add. That is, from a <i>
        GoAddElementsToCollectionAction</i> you can use <i>getTab()</i> to
      manipulate the way the list behaves.
      <h3><a name="refining-the-action-to-add-elements-to-a-collection"></a>Refining
        the action to add elements to a collection</h3>
      A useful improvement for the orders collection would be that when the user
      adds orders to the current invoice, the detail lines of those orders will
      be copied automatically to the invoice.<br>
      We cannot use the <i>@AddAction</i> for this, because it is the action to
      show the list to add elements to the collection. But this is not the
      action that adds the elements. <br>
      Let's learn how to define the action that actually adds the elements: <br>
      <img src="files/references-collections_en70.png" alt="references-collections_en70.png"
        title="references-collections_en70.png"><br>
      Unfortunately, there is not an annotation to directly define this 'Add'
      action. However, that is not a very difficult task, we only have to refine
      the <i>@AddAction</i> instructing it to show our own controller, and in
      this controller we can put the actions we want. Given we already have
      defined our <i>@AddAction</i> in the previous section we only have to add
      a new method to the already existing <i>GoAddOrdersToInvoiceAction</i>
      class. Add the next <i>getNextController()</i> method to your action:
      <pre><code class="java">public class GoAddOrdersToInvoiceAction ... {

    ...

    public String getNextController() { // We add this method
        return "AddOrdersToInvoice"; // The controller with the available actions
    }                                // in the list of orders to add
}
</code></pre> By default the actions in the list of entities to add (the ADD and
      CANCEL buttons) are from the standard OpenXava controller <i>AddToCollection</i>.
      Overwriting <i>getNextController()</i> in our action allows us to define
      our own controller instead. Add the next definition in <i>controllers.xml</i>
      for our custom controller for adding elements:
      <pre><code class="xml">&lt;controller name="AddOrdersToInvoice"&gt;
    &lt;extends controller="AddToCollection" /&gt; &lt;!-- Extends from the standard controller --&gt;
	
    &lt;!-- Overwrites the action to add --&gt;
    &lt;action name="add"
        class="com.yourcompany.invoicing.actions.AddOrdersToInvoiceAction" /&gt;
		
&lt;/controller&gt;
</code></pre> In this way the action to add orders to the invoice is <i>AddOrdersToInvoiceAction</i>.
      Remember that the goal of our action is to add the orders to the invoice
      in the usual way, but also to copy the detail lines from those orders to
      the invoice. This is the code of the action:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">package com.yourcompany.invoicing.actions; // In 'actions' package

import java.rmi.*;
import java.util.*;
import javax.ejb.*;
import org.openxava.actions.*; // To use AddElementsToCollectionAction
import org.openxava.model.*;
import org.openxava.util.*;
import org.openxava.validators.*;
import com.yourcompany.invoicing.model.*;

public class AddOrdersToInvoiceAction
    extends AddElementsToCollectionAction { // Standard logic for adding
                                            // collection elements
    public void execute() throws Exception {
        super.execute(); // We use the standard logic "as is"
        getView().refresh(); // To display fresh data, including recalculated
    }                        // amounts, which depend on detail lines

    protected void associateEntity(Map keyValues) // The method called to associate
        throws ValidationException, // each entity to the main one, in this case to
            XavaException, ObjectNotFoundException,// associate each order to the invoice
            FinderException, RemoteException
    {
        super.associateEntity(keyValues); // It executes the standard logic (1)
        Order order = (Order) MapFacade.findEntity("Order", keyValues); // (2)
        order.copyDetailsToInvoice(); // Delegates the main work to the entity (3)
    }
}
</code></pre> We overwrite the <i>execute()</i> method only to refresh the view
      after the process. Really, we want to refine the logic for associating an
      order to the invoice. The way to do this is overwriting the <i>associateEntity()</i>
      method. The logic here is simple, after executing the standard logic (1)
      we search the corresponding <i>Order</i> entity and then call the <i>copyDetailsToInvoice()</i>
      in that <i>Order</i>. Luckily we already have a method to copy details
      from an <i>Order</i> to the specified <i>Invoice</i>, we just call this
      method. </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">Now you only have to create a new
      invoice, choose a customer and add orders. It is even easier than using
      the list mode of <i>Order</i> module because from <i>Invoice</i> module
      only the suitable orders for the customer are shown.
      <h2><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h2>
      This lesson has shown you how to refine the standard behavior of
      references and collections in order for your application to fit the users
      needs. Here you only have seen some illustrative examples, but OpenXava
      provides many more possibilities for refining collections and references,
      such as the next annotations: <i>@ReferenceView, @ReadOnly, @NoFrame,
        @NoCreate, @NoModify, @NoSearch, @AsEmbedded, @SearchAction,
        @DescriptionsList, @LabelFormat, @Action, @OnChange, @OnChangeSearch,
        @Editor, @CollectionView, @EditOnly, @ListProperties, @RowStyle,
        @EditAction, @ViewAction, @NewAction, @SaveAction, @HideDetailAction,
        @RemoveAction, @RemoveSelectedAction, @ListAction, @DetailAction</i> and
      <i>@OnSelectElementAction</i>. Look at the <a href="view_en.html#View-Reference%20customization">Reference
        customization</a> and <a href="view_en.html#View-Collection%20customization">Collection
        customization</a> sections of reference guide.<br>
      And if that wasn't enough you always have the option of <a href="customizing_en.html">defining
        your own editor</a> for references or collections. Editors allows you to
      create a custom user interface component for displaying and editing the
      reference or collection. <br>
      This flexibility allows you to use automatic user interfaces for
      practically any possible case in real life business applications. </div>
