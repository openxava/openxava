Some knowledge of database is required for this guide. You should have installed OpenXava too.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc1"><a name="x-Starting up HSQL server"></a>Starting up HSQL server</h2>
We have created a database called management-db (or perhaps we want to create it), so from the command-line we place in the folder <em>openxava2.X/portal/bin</em> (where openxava2.x is the folder we have installed Openxava) we run<br />
<ul><li>In Linux/Unix: ./starthsqldb.sh management-db 1666</li><li>In Windows: starthsqldb management-db 1666</li></ul>And we have started up the HSQL database server and a service at the port 1666.<br />
<br />

We can get this program from the HSQL web and install it. Then we execute <strong>runManagerSwing.bat</strong> from the subfolder <strong>demo</strong>. Now we can administrate better our database <em>management-db.</em> In the next display we can see the options to connect to the database.<br />

In the next example, we have a catalogue named &quot;GESTIO&quot; and several tables created. One of these tables is ININ03. Now we can try to use SQL commands to create tables or to retrieve information. We should use a &quot;_&quot; to separate the catalog form the table to use the SELECT commands as we can see as follows.<br />
