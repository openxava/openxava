      An entity may inherit from another entity. This entity inheritance is a
      useful tool to simplify your model. We are going to use it to add a new <em>Order</em>
      entity to your <em>Invoicing</em> application.<br>
      <div class="wiki" style="display: block;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDcyGI-A0o0&amp;list=PL60bTC1NPyZ7PzIND-CrYI_T35BogUv6A&amp;index=8"

      <h2><a name="new-order-entity"></a>New Order entity</h2>
      We want to add a new concept to the <em>Invoicing</em> application, i.
      e., order. While an invoice is something you want to charge your customer,
      an order is something the customer has ordered from us. These two concepts
      are strongly related, because you will charge the things your customer has
      ordered from you, and you actually have served him.<br>
      It would be nice to manage orders in your application, and to associate
      those orders with its corresponding invoices. Just as shown in the next
      UML diagram:<br>
      <img src="files/inheritance_en010.png" alt="inheritance_en010.png" title="inheritance_en010.png"><br>
      And with Java code:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">@Entity
public class Invoice {
 
    @OneToMany(mappedBy="invoice")
    Collection&lt;Order&gt; orders;
    ...
}
 
@Entity
public class Order {
 
    @ManyToOne // Without lazy fetching (1)
    Invoice invoice;
    ...
}
</code></pre> That is, an invoice has several orders, and an order can reference
      an invoice. Note that we do not use lazy fetching for the <em>invoice</em>
      reference (1), this is because of a Hibernate bug when the reference owns
      the bidirectional relationship (that is, it's declared in the <em>mappedBy</em>
      attribute of the <em>@OneToMany</em>).<br>
      What shape does <em>Order</em> have? Well, it has a customer, several
      detail lines with product and quantity, a year and a number, something
      like this:<br>
      <img src="files/inheritance_en020.png" alt="inheritance_en020.png" title="inheritance_en020.png"><br>
      Incidentally, this UML diagram is identical to the <em>Invoice</em>
      diagram. That is, to create your <em>Order</em> entity you can just copy
      and paste the <em>Invoice</em> class, and the work is done. But, wait a
      moment! “Copy and paste” is a mortal sin. So, we have to find a way to
      reuse <em>Invoice</em> code for <em>Order</em>.<br>
      <h2><a name="commercialdocument-as-an-abstract-entity"></a>CommercialDocument
        as an abstract entity</h2>
      A practical way to reuse the code for <em>Invoice</em> and <em>Order</em>
      is by using inheritance, moreover it's an excellent opportunity to learn
      how easy it is to use inheritance with JPA and OpenXava.<br>
      In most object oriented cultures you have to observe the <em>is a</em>
      rule. It means that we cannot do <em>Invoice</em> extends <em>Order</em>,
      because an <em>Invoice</em> is not an <em>Order</em>. The solution for
      this case is creating a base class for both <em>Order</em> and <em>Invoice</em>.
      We are going to call that class <em>CommercialDocument</em>.<br>
      Here you have the UML diagram for <em>CommercialDocument</em>:<br>
      <img src="files/inheritance_en030.png" alt="inheritance_en030.png" title="inheritance_en030.png"><br>
      And here you have the same idea expressed with Java:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">public class CommercialDocument { ... }
public class Order extends CommercialDocument { ... }
public class Invoice extends CommercialDocument { ... }
</code></pre> Let's start to refactor your current code. First, rename (using <em>Refactor
        &gt; Rename</em>) <em>Invoice</em> as <em>CommercialDocument</em>.
      Now, edit the <em>CommercialDocument</em> code to declare it as an
      abstract class, thus:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">abstract public class CommercialDocument // We add the abstract modifier
</code></pre> We want to create instances of <em>Invoice</em> and <em>Order</em>,
      but we do not want to create instances of <em>CommercialDocument</em>
      directly, so we declare it as abstract.<br>
      <h2><a name="invoice-refactored-to-use-inheritance"></a>Invoice refactored
        to use inheritance</h2>
      Now, you have to create the <em>Invoice</em> entity extending it from <em>CommercialDocument</em>.
      See the new <em>Invoice</em> code:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">package com.yourcompany.invoicing.model;
 
import javax.persistence.*;
import lombok.*;
 
@Entity @Getter @Setter
public class Invoice extends CommercialDocument {
 
}
</code></pre> <em>Invoice</em> now has very succinct code, indeed the body of
      the class is, by now, empty.<br>
      This new code requires a slightly different database schema, now invoices
      and orders will be stored in the same table (the CommercialDocument table)
      using a discriminator column. Therefore you need to remove the old tables
      executing the next SQL statements:<br>
      <pre><code class="sql">DROP TABLE INVOICING.INVOICE_DETAILS;
DROP TABLE INVOICING.INVOICE;
</code></pre> To execute these SQL statements, first make sure your application
      is running, then use the menu option <i>OpenXava &gt; Database Manager</i>
      of OpenXava Studio:<br>
      <img src="files/inheritance040.png" alt="inheritance040.png" title="inheritance040.png"><br>
      Then:<br>
      <img src="files/inheritance_en050.png" alt="inheritance_en050.png" title="inheritance_en050.png"><br>
      Now you can execute the <em>Invoice</em> module and see it working in
      your browser. Also, execute the <em>InvoiceTest</em>. It must be green.</div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">If you use your own version of
      Eclipse or IntelliJ you can run the Database Manager executing the <i>runDBManager</i>
      Ant target of <i>OpenXava/build.xml</i>.<br>
      <h2><a name="creating-order-using-inheritance"></a>Creating Order using
        inheritance</h2>
      Thanks to <em>CommercialDocument</em> creating the <em>Order</em> entity
      is dead easy. See the code:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">package com.yourcompany.invoicing.model;
 
import javax.persistence.*;
import lombok.*;
 
@Entity @Getter @Setter
public class Order extends CommercialDocument {
 
}
</code></pre> After writing the above <em>Order</em> class, although it is
      empty by now, you can use the <em>Order</em> module from your browser.
      Yes, creating a new entity with a structure like <em>Invoice</em>, that
      is any commercial document entity, is very easy and rapid. You see how
      good use of inheritance is an elegant way to have simpler code.<br>
      <em>Order</em> module works perfectly, but it has a little problem. The
      new order number is calculated from the last invoice number, not from the
      last order number. This is because the calculator for the next number is
      read from the <em>Invoice</em> entity. An obvious solution is to move the
      <em>number</em> property definition from <em>CommercialDocument</em> to <em>Invoice</em>
      and <em>Order</em>. Although, we are not going to do it in this way,
      because in the next lesson we'll refine the way to calculate the next
      number, for now we simply do a little adjustment in the current code so
      that it does not fail. Edit the <em>NextNumberForYearCalculator</em>
      class and in the query change “Invoice” for “CommercialDocument”, leaving
      the <em>calculate()</em> method, in this way:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">public Object calculate() throws Exception {
    Query query = XPersistence.getManager().createQuery(
        "select max(i.number) from " +
        "CommercialDocument i " + // CommercialDocument instead of Invoice
        "where i.year = :year");
    query.setParameter("year", year);
    Integer lastNumber = (Integer) query.getSingleResult();
    return lastNumber == null?1:lastNumber + 1;
}
</code></pre> Now we search for the maximum number of any commercial document of
      the year in order to calculate the new number, therefore the numbering is
      shared across all the commercial documents. We'll improve it in the next
      lesson for having separate numbering for invoices and orders and to have
      better support for a multiuser environment.<br>
      <h2><a name="naming-convention-and-inheritance"></a>Naming convention and
        inheritance</h2>
      Note that you do not need to change the name of any property of <em>Invoice</em>
      to do the refactoring. This is because we follow the next pragmatic
      principle: <em>Do not use the class name in member names</em>, e.g.,
      inside an <em>Account</em> class do not use the “Account” word in any
      method or property:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">public class Account { // We'll not use Account in member names
 
    private int accountNumber; // Bad, because it uses “account”
    private int number; // Good, it does not use “account”
 
    public void cancelAccount() { } // Bad, because it uses “Account”
    public void cancel() { } // Good, it does not use “account”
    ...
}
</code></pre> Using this nomenclature you can refactor <em>Account</em> in an
      inheritance hierarchy without renaming its members, and you can write
      polymorphic code with <em>Account</em>.<br>
      <h2><a name="associating-order-with-invoice"></a>Associating Order with
        Invoice</h2>
      By now, <em>Order</em> and <em>Invoice</em> are exactly the same. We are
      going to do the first extensions on them, that is to associate <em>Order</em>
      with <em>Invoice</em>. Just as shown in the diagram:<br>
      <img src="files/inheritance_en010.png" alt="inheritance_en010.png" title="inheritance_en010.png"><br>
      You only need to add a reference from <em>Order</em> to <em>Invoice</em>:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">package com.yourcompany.invoicing.model;
 
import javax.persistence.*;
import lombok.*;
 
@Entity @Getter @Setter
public class Order extends CommercialDocument {
 
    @ManyToOne
    Invoice invoice; // Reference to invoice added
 
}
</code></pre> Conversely in <em>Invoice</em> we add a collection of <em>Order</em>
      entities:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">package com.yourcompany.invoicing.model;
 
import java.util.*; 
import javax.persistence.*;
import lombok.*;
 
@Entity @Getter @Setter
public class Invoice extends CommercialDocument {
 
    @OneToMany(mappedBy="invoice")
    Collection&lt;Order&gt; orders; // Collection of Order entities added
 
}
</code></pre> After writing this simple code you are ready to test the newly
      created relationship. Restart your application and open your browser and
      explore the <em>Order</em> and the <em>Invoice</em> modules. Note that
      at the end of the <em>Order</em> user interface you have a reference to <em>Invoice</em>.
      The user can use this reference to associate an invoice with the current
      order. On the other hand, if you explore the <em>Invoice</em> module, you
      will see a collection of orders at the end. The user can use it to add
      orders to the current invoice.<br>
      Try to add orders to invoice, and to associate an invoice to an order. It
      works, although the user interface is a little ugly. Don't worry we'll
      improve it in the next lesson.<br>

      <h2 id="toc18"><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h2>
      This lesson has shown you some practical examples about how to use the
      inheritance of Java with JPA enties to simplify your code. We used the
      default JPA configuration for inheritance, though you can refine JPA
      behavior for inheritance using some JPA annotations like <em>@Inheritance</em>,
      <em>@DiscriminatorColumn</em>, <em>@DiscriminatorValue</em>, etc. To
      learn more about inheritance in JPA read the documents cited in <a class="wiki_link"
