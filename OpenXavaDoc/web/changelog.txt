OpenXava 2.0.4 (2006-12-19)
---------------------------

OpenXava 2.0.3 (2006-10-02)
---------------------------
UI BEHAVIOUR
- It's possible to remove several rows from collection at once, using a checkbox + action
- When you navigate or search to a new object all collections closes the detail view. In this way a lot of incorrect data display problems are removed.

XML SYNTAX
- Attribute 'maximum' (for validating maximum item count) allowed in <collection /> element.
- order in finder supports using a property of a reference inside an aggregate (address.state.name for example) for Hibernate and JPA.
- <action/> inside <members>, <property-view/> or <reference-view/> have the attribute 'always-enabled', when this attribute is true the action is always present, even if the view, property or reference are not editable.
- <action /> allowed inside members(groups and section) of view. In order to put an arbitrary action inside a view.

JAVA API

MISC

- Chapter 2 of reference guide uses 'updateSchema' for creating database.
- JPA code in POJOs only is generated if JPA persistence provider is set, or the property 'jpaCodeInPOJOs' in xava.properties is set to true. In this way POJOs can be compiled using a java 1.4 compiler.
- Default validators for type or stereotype are supported. They can be defined in validators.xml.
- If component name does not match with xml file name a meaningful message is produced
- <xava:descriptionsList/> JSP taglib added.
- <xava:message/> JSP taglib added.
- Calculated properties with IModelCalculator or IEntityCalculator are recalculated in view when some dependent value changed and an POJO (not EJB) populated with the current view data is injected in calculator before calculation.
- Custom JSP are allowed in root folder.
- It's possible to overwrite standard messages of OpenXava.
- XavaResources.properties dropped from OpenXava. All its content is moved to Messages.properties.
- Code generation for EJB2 exclude some finder cases only supported in Hibernate/EJB3
- Added 'as-aggregate' to <reference-view/> to allow entity references behave as aggregate references.
- It's possible override for our application a defaut controller of OpenXava (Collection, References, Typical, etc).
- OpenXava/xava/controllers.xml is renamed to OpenXava/xava/default-controllers.xml.

FIXES
- Fix: checkbox of rows in collection is not shown when collections are not editable
- Fix: SaveAction with resetAfter=false clear the data of references
- Fix: as-aggregate for in <reference-view/> does not work if the key of reference is autogenerated.
- Fix: View.setValueNotifying and View.setValuesExecutingOnChangeActions does not execute the same action more than once.
- Fix: Now CRUD.searchByViewKey does not throw on-change event for key in references, and CRUD.searchExecutingOnChange lanza on-change event for key in references. Now works as reference guide explains.
- Fix: OnChange action associated to a view used for create a new reference crash if add error or messages
- Fix: Editable mode of collection of entities inside an section fails.
- Fix: assertListRowCount(0) works fine in junit tests
- Fix: View.setEditable from inside a XAVA_SEARCH_ACTION in list mode does not affect to collections with <collection-view/>
- Fix: validator in aggregate that references to its parent of which key is single crash.
- Fix: If the user removing a column from tab and after he filter by a aggregate value then fails: Filter is not done, and the list is not well displayed

OpenXava 2.0.2 (2006-08-01)
---------------------------
- On creating a new object from a reference the reference view is filled automatically with the just created object.
- Added 'as-aggregate' to <collection-view/> to allow entity collections behave as aggregate collections.
- Added exportSchema and updateSchema to OpenXava/build.xml (see example in MySchool/MiEscuela build.xml)
- It's possible to refine the default behavior of a collection-view with new new-action, save-action, hide-detail-action and remove-action elements in collection-view
- add/removeListAction and add/removeDetailAction added to view. This allow add/remove programmatically actions to a collection view.
- hiddenDetail action of Collection controller in controllers.xml is renamed to hideDetail.
- New stereotype ZEROS_FILLED/RELLENADO_CON_CEROS
- Feedback to the user of standard action are improved, specially those of collection.
- Searching a reference using radio button instead of checkbox, because only an item can be selected.
- Allows spaces at end of persistenceProviderClass property value in xava.propeties.
- In upload forms (multiplar) any number of actions is allowed.
- In IMAGES_GALLERY stereotype there is a cancel action in the form for upload image.
- Added explicit support for identity (auto-increment) database columns by means of the new IdentityCalculator.
- IPropertyAction added, to allow inject property name and view to an action defined in an <property-view/>
- SearchByViewKeyAction has new protected methods for refining its behaviour easily.
- list.jsp admit the parameter singleSelection to indicate if the list has to use chechbox or radio button.
- CreateNewFromReferenceAction and SaveNewAction now have a property 'referenceSubview' (of View type) that has to be injected in controllers.xml. If you have some custom action that extends them remember modify your controllers.xml
- The order of elements in entity/aggregate are more flexible.
- Converters (defined in converters.xml or MyComponent.xml) are applied for not generated code too. In this case conversion is only used for list mode, and the programmer is responsible to include the conversion in get/set code.
- Some adaptation a oracle syntax: Inner joins for tab works fine with Oracle (" as " dropped).
 OpenXava is refined in order to avoid this jetspeed flaw
- All text editors are limited to 100 displayed charecters as maximum. You can customize it for you applicaction using maxSizeForTextEditor in xava.properties.
- The textEditor.jsp editor has a new parameter 'maxSize' that is assigned to the 'size' attribute of html <input /> element. You can use it in your own steroetypes.
- workspace.dir in openxava.properties (or equivalent) is ignore by OpenXava. Therefore, from now on you can rename the folder of your workspace without worrying about to change your openxava.properties.
- Key with 0 as value works in searching
- The ERROR messages on deleting the last object are not shown if removal is done correctly.
- xava-junit.properties support the 'application' property to indicate the default value for
	the application to all the junit test the project.
- Image editor does not show the broken image when there is no image.

- Fix: descriptions-list with order and without condition fails
- Fix: collections of references to entities are full editable inside sections.
- Fix: Sterotype IMAGES_GALLERY crash when the property is not in i18n files.
- Fix: request.getLocale() throws NullPointerException in some circumstance inside Jetspeed2.

- Fix: Bug in CollectionBaseAction.getObjects()
- Fix: collection of aggregates inside group inside section fails
- Fix: Searching in detail fails with boolean and properties with converters
- Fix: Searching in detail fails when more than one match to the searching
